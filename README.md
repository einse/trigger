# trigger
A simple text parser.

## How to Use It

Just run the script "trigger.py" by using Python 2 interpreter:

    python2 trigger.py

If the current directory contains a file named "examples.txt",
the script will read it; then, if strings provided, they will be
tokenized.

If "examples.txt" is not found, the usage info will be printed.

You can also invoke the usage info by adding the ```--help``` flag
(note that the script execution will be halted, even if any other flags
provided):

    python2 trigger.py --help

## Technical Details
